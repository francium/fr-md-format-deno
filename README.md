# fr-md-format

A custom markdown formatter. Written as a standalone script in Deno.

Formats markdown the way I prefer. I made this for personal use, so you may not
be interest in this plugin.


## Installation

Make sure you have [Deno][deno-url] installed and copy `fr-md-format.ts` to
somewhere in your `$PATH`.

[deno-url]: https://deno.com/runtime


## Usage

```txt
$ fr-md-format.ts <markdown file>
```

Note due to how Deno works, the `.ts` extension must be present on the file for
Deno to work.
